/**
 * Represents a moveable holiday whose date varies from year to year based on specific calculation
 * rules.
 *
 * <p>Moveable holidays are holidays that do not occur on the same calendar date each year. Instead,
 * their dates are calculated using various algorithms based on astronomical events, other holidays,
 * or weekday patterns. This class implements the complex logic required to determine these variable
 * dates while maintaining the Data-Oriented Programming principles of immutable data structures and
 * separated operations.
 *
 * <p><strong>Calculation Methods:</strong>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Lunar-based:</strong> Uses astronomical calculations (e.g., Easter Sunday)
 *   <li><strong>Relative to holiday:</strong> Calculated as offset from another holiday (e.g., Good
 *       Friday)
 *   <li><strong>Weekday-based:</strong> Uses weekday rules (e.g., first Monday of September)
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><strong>Easter Calculation:</strong>
 *
 * <p>This class implements the Western Christian Easter calculation using the algorithm by Jean
 * Meeus from "Astronomical Algorithms" (1991). The algorithm is accurate for all years in the
 * Gregorian calendar (1583 onwards) and handles the complex astronomical relationships between
 * solar and lunar calendars.
 *
 * <p><strong>Key Features:</strong>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Multiple calculation types:</strong> Supports lunar, relative, and weekday-based
 *       holidays
 *   <li><strong>Astronomical accuracy:</strong> Implements precise Easter calculation algorithm
 *   <li><strong>Mondayisation support:</strong> Automatic weekend adjustment for public holidays
 *   <li><strong>Immutable design:</strong> Thread-safe and predictable behavior
 *   <li><strong>Comprehensive validation:</strong> Input validation and error handling
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><strong>Usage Examples:</strong>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Easter Sunday (lunar-based)
 * MoveableHoliday easter = new MoveableHoliday(
 *     "Easter Sunday", "Resurrection of Jesus Christ",
 *     0, Month.JANUARY, // Not used for lunar-based
 *     localities, HolidayType.RELIGIOUS, true,
 *     MoveableHolidayType.LUNAR_BASED, null, 0
 * );
 *
 * // Good Friday (relative to Easter)
 * MoveableHoliday goodFriday = new MoveableHoliday(
 *     "Good Friday", "Crucifixion of Jesus Christ",
 *     0, Month.JANUARY, // Not used for relative
 *     localities, HolidayType.RELIGIOUS, true,
 *     MoveableHolidayType.RELATIVE_TO_HOLIDAY, easter, -2
 * );
 *
 * // Labor Day (weekday-based)
 * MoveableHoliday laborDay = new MoveableHoliday(
 *     "Labor Day", "Workers' rights celebration",
 *     1, Month.SEPTEMBER, // First Monday of September
 *     localities, HolidayType.NATIONAL, true,
 *     MoveableHolidayType.WEEKDAY_BASED, null, 0
 * );
 *
 * // Calculate dates for specific year
 * LocalDate easter2024 = easter.getDate(2024);      // 2024-03-31
 * LocalDate goodFriday2024 = goodFriday.getDate(2024); // 2024-03-29
 * LocalDate laborDay2024 = laborDay.getDate(2024);     // 2024-09-02
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p><strong>Easter Algorithm Details:</strong>
 *
 * <p>The Easter calculation uses the Metonic cycle (19-year period where lunar phases repeat on the
 * same solar calendar dates) and applies various corrections for the Gregorian calendar reform,
 * leap years, and astronomical variations. The algorithm involves 10 distinct steps with
 * well-documented mathematical constants.

  /**
   * Calculates Easter Sunday using the Western Christian algorithm (Gregorian calendar). Based on
   * the algorithm by Jean Meeus from "Astronomical Algorithms" (1991).
   *
   * <p><strong>How Easter is Determined:</strong>
   *
   * <p>Easter is defined as the first Sunday after the first full moon occurring on or after the
   * spring equinox (March 21). This definition was established by the Council of Nicaea in 325 AD
   * to ensure all Christian churches celebrate Easter on the same date.
   *
   * <p><strong>Algorithm Steps:</strong>
   *
   * <ol>
   *   <li><strong>Golden Number:</strong> Determines the year's position in the 19-year Metonic
   *       cycle, which approximates the lunar calendar alignment with solar years.
   *   <li><strong>Century Calculations:</strong> Separates the year into century and
   *       year-within-century for leap year corrections.
   *   <li><strong>Gregorian Corrections:</strong> Applies corrections for the Gregorian calendar
   *       reform (1582) to account for lunar orbit variations.
   *   <li><strong>Epact Calculation:</strong> Determines the age of the moon on January 1st, which
   *       is crucial for finding the correct lunar month.
   *   <li><strong>Paschal Full Moon:</strong> Calculates when the ecclesiastical full moon occurs
   *       in March or April.
   *   <li><strong>Easter Sunday:</strong> Finds the first Sunday after the Paschal Full Moon.
   * </ol>
   *
   * <p><strong>Mathematical Foundation:</strong>
   *
   * <p>The algorithm uses modular arithmetic to handle the cyclical nature of both solar and lunar
   * calendars. The key insight is that lunar phases repeat every 19 solar years (Metonic cycle),
   * allowing for predictable calculations without astronomical observations.
   *
   * <p><strong>Accuracy:</strong>
   *
   * <p>This algorithm is accurate for all years in the Gregorian calendar (1583 onwards) and
   * produces the same dates used by Western Christian churches worldwide.
   *
   * <p><strong>Example Calculations:</strong>
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>2024: March 31 (early Easter due to leap year)
   *   <li>2025: April 20 (late Easter)
   *   <li>2026: April 5 (typical Easter date)
   * </ul>
   *
   * @param year the year for which to calculate Easter (must be ≥ 1583 for Gregorian accuracy)
   * @return the date of Easter Sunday for the given year
   * @throws IllegalArgumentException if year is before 1583 (pre-Gregorian calendar)
