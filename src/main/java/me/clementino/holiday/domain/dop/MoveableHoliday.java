/**
 * Moveable holiday that is calculated using algorithms and may vary from year to year.
 *
 * <p>This record implements the Holiday interface, automatically inheriting all common methods
 * without repetition. It adds moveable-specific attributes: known holiday type and mondayisation
 * flag.
 *
 * <p><strong>Examples:</strong>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Easter Sunday (calculated using lunar calendar)
 *   <li>Thanksgiving (4th Thursday of November in US)
 *   <li>Memorial Day (last Monday of May in US)
 *   <li>Labor Day (1st Monday of September in US)
 *   <li>Mother's Day (2nd Sunday of May)
 *   <li>Father's Day (3rd Sunday of June)
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><strong>Calculation:</strong> The date field contains a calculated date for a specific year.
 * To get the date for a different year, use HolidayOperations.calculateDate() which will return a
 * new instance with the recalculated date.
 *
 * <p><strong>DOP Principles:</strong>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Immutable</strong>: All fields are final, transformation methods return new
 *       instances
 *   <li><strong>Transparent</strong>: All data is directly accessible
 *   <li><strong>Complete</strong>: Contains exactly the data needed for a moveable holiday
 *   <li><strong>Valid</strong>: Constructor validation prevents illegal states
 * </ul>
