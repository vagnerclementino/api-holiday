/**
 * Holiday that is calculated relative to another holiday with a day offset.
 *
 * <p>This record implements the Holiday interface, automatically inheriting all common methods
 * without repetition. It adds derived-specific attributes: known holiday type, base holiday, day
 * offset, and mondayisation flag.
 *
 * <p><strong>Examples:</strong>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Good Friday (2 days before Easter)
 *   <li>Easter Monday (1 day after Easter)
 *   <li>Palm Sunday (7 days before Easter)
 *   <li>Ash Wednesday (46 days before Easter)
 *   <li>Black Friday (1 day after Thanksgiving)
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><strong>Calculation:</strong> The date is calculated by first determining the base holiday's
 * date for a given year, then adding the day offset. Positive offsets are days after the base
 * holiday, negative offsets are days before.
 *
 * <p><strong>DOP Principles:</strong>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Immutable</strong>: All fields are final, transformation methods return new
 *       instances
 *   <li><strong>Transparent</strong>: All data is directly accessible
 *   <li><strong>Complete</strong>: Contains exactly the data needed for a derived holiday
 *   <li><strong>Valid</strong>: Constructor validation prevents illegal states
 * </ul>
